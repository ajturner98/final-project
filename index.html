    <p><strong>Fifth Edition Dungeons and Dragons</strong> is the 2014 redeign of the iconic roleplaying game. This guide will explain some of the most confusing concepts in D&D including the classes, the races, the character sheet and combat. This guide is meant to help you understand your character and combat when you sit down in a group.</p>

    <h2>Here are answers to some of the first questions you may have when starting to play D&D!</h2>

        <dl>
          <div class="qs">
          <dt>What is D&D? I've heard of it but I never really understood what it was.</dt>
            <dd>Dungeons and Dragons is a tabletop roleplaying game that first came about in 1974. In the game, players collectively tell a story while using dice to simulate randomness. In it, the Dungeon Master, or DM, controls all non-player characters like the friendly bartender or the scheming noble. Meanwhile <strong>you</strong> and the other players control the main characters of the story. That said, it's not the players vs the DM. In <em>most</em> cases, the DM wants the players to win just as much as you all do.</dd>
          </div>
          <div class="qs">
            <dt>What do I need to bring? Do I need to go out and buy things before my first session?</dt>
              <dd>There are a few essentials that you need when playing D&D. Number one is a set of polyhedral dice like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=polyhedral+dice&crid=2HNJO8QECHFL3&sprefix=polyhe%2Caps%2C156&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_6">these</a>. It's also likely that one of the other players or the DM has an extra set that you can borrow if you don't want to immediately buy dice. You'll also need a character sheet, which is where you store all the important information about your chatacter. You can print out the fifth edition character sheet <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/5E_CharacterSheet_Fillable.pdf">here</a>.</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="qs">
            <dt>I've heard that there are three main rule books. Should I buy them?</dt>
              <dd>Before you play your first game, you definitely <strong>SHOULDN'T</strong> buy the books. If like it and want to continue playing after your first time, it's worthwhile to invest in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Players-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons-Wizards/dp/0786965606">Players Handbook</a>. If you want to be a Dungeon Master, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Dungeon-Rulebook-Roleplaying/dp/0786965622/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/132-3835107-3217816?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0786965622&pd_rd_r=4d47ccfc-1ed1-41ab-b35e-3d2d78695083&pd_rd_w=bdHSz&pd_rd_wg=M9fCG&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=9PKBK519ERRPFXY2JCZD&psc=1&refRID=9PKBK519ERRPFXY2JCZD">Dungeon Master's Guide</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeons-Dragons-Monster-Rulebook-Roleplaying/dp/0786965614/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Dungeons+%26+Dragons+Monster+Manual+%28Core+Rulebook%2C+D%26D+Roleplaying+Game%29&qid=1575416488&s=books&sr=1-1">Monster Manual</a> are both useful for building the best settings possible.</dd>
            </div>
            <div class="qs">
            <dt>I'm nervous. What if I mess up?</dt>
              <dd>In short: don't worry. The worst thing that can happen when you play D&D is your character dies, but even that's not too bad because you can make a new one and it might even make for good storytelling. As long as everyone at the table (including you) enjoys themselves, it's a successful session.</dd>
