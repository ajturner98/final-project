    <p>There are 13 official classes in fifth edition Dungeons and Dragons — 12 of which comes from the Player's Handbook and one from Eberron: Rising from the Last War. Note that this won't help you build your charater (you need the books for that), but it will help you choose what class you want to play! Since Eberron just came out and most people don't have the book yet, this guide will only cover the Player's Handbook classes.</p>

      <div id="barbarian" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/barbarian.png" alt="barbarian">
        <h2>Barbarian</h2>
        <p class="description">Everyone experiences rage, but only a barbarian can use pure anger to enhance their figihing ability. By flying into a potent rage, a barbarian can reduce damage taken, increase their strength and more. This class is a front lines combatant skilled at taking and dealing tons of damage. One drawback tends to be that they're sometimes limited outside of battle, but they more than make up for it through martial prowess.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="bard" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/bard.png" alt="bard">
        <h2>Bard</h2>
        <p class="description">When one has mastered an art so thouroughly that it becomes imbued with magic, they are truly worthy of being called a bard. Through their tremendous talent, they are able to cast all different kinds of spells to take down the enemy. The bard primarily uses support magic through healing and crowd control spells, so don't expect to deal tons of damage. They also can inspire allies in battle, giving bonuses to their rolls.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="cleric" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/cleric.png" alt="cleric">
        <h2>Cleric</h2>
        <p class="description">The gods carve their will on the Material Plane through their mortal servants, and those blessed with this divine power are called clerics. Normally the support of the group, the cleric weilds their holy powers to aid the party. Even though they are geared towards healing, clerics can hold their own with a high armor class and powerful attack spells. They also gain a number of extra powers based on their god's domain.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="druid" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/druid.png" alt="druid">
        <h2>Druid</h2>
        <p class="description">Nature caries its own special magic and druids are those mortals who can tap into it. Druids are shapeshifting spellcasters capable of transforming into a wide range of animals. They also occupy a sort of middle ground in variety of spells with a nice mix of offensive and defensive spells as well as nature spells that help in roleplay. As you level up, you can turn into progressively better animals and summon more powerful animal companions.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="fighter" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/fighter.png" alt="fighter">
        <h2>Fighter</h2>
        <p class="description">Often know as one of the easiest classes for new players to learn, the fighter is really good at, well, fighting. They deal a lot of damage and are hard for enemies to hit, which is a boon for any adventuring party. While different subclasses of fighters get unique abilities, they all get an Action Surge, which lets you take a second action (often used to take all your attacks again), and Second Wind, which heals you for a few points of health.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="monk" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/monk.png" alt="monk">
        <h2>Monk</h2>
        <p class="description">Masters of martials arts who become so skilled at their craft that they are able to channel the power of Ki are known as monks. Unlike the other front line classes, monks use their fists to land Unarmed Strike attacks against enemies, and they can use their Ki points gained at level 2 to power up their attacks or boost their acrobatic skills. The monk is a dexterity-based combatant so the monk has multiple features dedicated to attacking and then moving away.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="paladin" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/paladin.png" alt="paladin">
        <h2>Paladin</h2>
        <p class="description">Holy knights who have sworn an oath to fight for a god gain magical powers that make them even more powerful. These paladins are capable of imbuing their attacks with radiant energy to smite their enemies. They can also cast spells and at higher levels, they gain features that buff up their allies. While they're normally played as lawful good, that doesn't have to be the case! There are gods of all different alignments and your paladin should choose the one they want. No matter your alignment and oath, you'll be lighting up enemies with holy (or unholy) smites that will make Tiamat herself cower in fear!</p>
      </div>

      <div id="ranger" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/ranger.png" alt="ranger">
        <h2>Ranger</h2>
        <p class="description">When you combine the ranged fighting prowess of a fighter with the animal handling skills of a druid, you end up with a ranger! Capable of sniping down enemies from great distance, the ranger is the perfect hunter thanks to their natural talent and magical ability. Rangers also have special features called favored enemy and natural terrain that grant them bonuses depending on the enemy and environment. This ability can be underwhelming if you chose the forest and the entire campaign takes place in the city, so talk to your DM beforehand about this.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="rogue" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/rogue.png" alt="rogue">
        <h2>Rogue</h2>
        <p class="description">Stalking though the shadows are the ever evasive theives, assassins and other criminals who have master the ways of the rogue. Rogues can disarm traps, steal from anyone and hide so well they might as well be invisible, which makes them invaluable to the party. They also more than earn their stripes in combat as they deal tons of extra damage every time they get their sneak attack. Theivery isn't the only path for a rogue; they can also be masterminds or swashbucklers for a different take on the class. After leveling up, they also gain features that improve their dexterity.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="sorcerer" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/sorcerer.png" alt="sorcerer">
        <h2>Sorcerer</h2>
        <p class="description">Those born with a powerful connection to arcane magic, or who maybe have that magic forced upon them by some mystical occurence, are known as sorcerers. These casters have access to a wide range of magical spells capable of performing helpful actions or dealing massive amounts of damage. Depending on how you got your magic also determines some extra features, and you can use sorcery points aid you in battle. Be warned though — sorcerers normally don't have a lot of health and is a back line fighter.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="warlock" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/warlock.png" alt="warlock">
        <h2>Warlock</h2>
        <p class="description">Warlocks are those who gain their magic through a pact with powerful, magical patrons. Warlocks patrons include devils, faries, possesed weapons and more. In exchange for your service, and sometimes your soul, you can cast magic and gain invocations that turn you into a magic user. Before chosing warlock, it's important to know that this class can only cast their more powerful spells two times in between rests. They do, however, gain invocations which grant different powers and abilities to make up for the lack of spell slots.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="wizard" class="class">
        <img src="images/classes/wizard.png" alt="wizard">
        <h2>Wizard</h2>
        <p class="description">To quote the great Dungeon Master Brennan Lee Mulligan, "No one f@%ks with a wizard!" At least at higher levels people won't. Wizards are the masters of the arcane who gain their powers through years of dedicated study. Since they're more suited for a library than a battlefield, it doesn't take a lot of damage to reduce a wizard to 0 HP. That said, a wizard's spells can often turn the tide of the battlefield thanks to the extensive list of spells they can learn. Their arcane tradition also unlocks specialized skills based on the magical school.</p>
