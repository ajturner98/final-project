    <p>Fifth edition Dungeons and Dragons has a ton of races. You can be anything from a human to a goblin to an  elephant person! However, if you just starting out playing D&D, you'll probably want to play one of the nine races in the Player's Handbook.</p>

    <div id="races">

      <div id="dragonborn" class="race">
        <img src="images/races/dragonborn.png" alt="dragonborn">
        <h2>Dragonborn</h2>
        <p class="description">A mortal race born of dragons, dragonborn look like bipedal dragons without wings or a tail. Different dragonborn have blood from different colors of dragons and as such, their breath weapon changes based on their color. When in smaller towns it's worth keeping an eye open â€” some people mistrust the kin of dragons.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="dwarf" class="race">
        <img src="images/races/dwarf.png" alt="dwarf">
        <h2>Dwarf</h2>
        <p class="description">Holed up in their mountain strongholds, dwarves are mistrustful of outsiders and protective of their clan. These master crafters may be stout, but their strength should never be underestimated. Dwarves can live for hundreds of years, and their society teaches to value religion, treasure and family above all else.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="elf" class="race">
        <img src="images/races/elf.png" alt="elf">
        <h2>Elf</h2>
        <p class="description">The graceful and long-lived elves exist to engage their passions and master their crafts. Since they can live for over 700 years, elves don't often involve themselves in the happenings of the outside world and instead focus on pursuing their own goals. When they do leave their seculded forest, it is often out of a desire for exploration and discovery.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="gnome" class="race">
        <img src="images/races/gnome.png" alt="gnome">
        <h2>Gnome</h2>
        <p class="description">These tiny tinkerers are abound with positivity. Being alive is amazing and gnomes need to get every bit of enjoyment it has. Even though they live for centuries, gnomes worry that they will not get through everything they want to do. They can sometimes be a bit mischevious because many gnomes enjoy pulling pranks on others.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="halelf" class="race">
        <img src="images/races/halfelf.png" alt="half elf">
        <h2>Half Elf</h2>
        <p class="description">Althought they're blessed with the best traits of humans and elves, half-elves find themselves in the sad situation of belonging to neither world. They're seen as too elven for human society and too human for elven society because their life span falls between the two races. Feeling at home nowhere, half-elves often set out to become an adventurer.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="Halfling" class="race">
        <img src="images/races/halfling.png" alt="halfling">
        <h2>Halfling</h2>
        <p class="description">These little folk don't often like to leave their homes, but when they do, it's in normally in service of some cause like helping their friends or saving their community. Halflings easily blend into the local population and their passion for work rewards them well. Though they prefer to stay at home, they always bring a little extra luck to any party they're on.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="halforc" class="race">
        <img src="images/races/halforc.png" alt="halforc">
        <h2>Half Orc</h2>
        <p class="description">Complete with the cunning of humans and the strength of orcs, half-orcs are born when a human and orc tribe form an allience and they inter-marry as a result. Due to influence of the orcish god Gruumsh One-Eye in their blood, they still expereince a lust for battle and strong emotional responses, but their human blood tempers their worst impulses.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="Human" class="race">
        <img src="images/races/human.png" alt="human">
        <h2>Human</h2>
        <p class="description">The youngest of the common races, humans strive to acomplish much in their short lives, and their adaptabiliy suits them well for pursuing any goal. While dwarves and elves both have overacrhing ideologies that define them, humans have no such similarities. One thing that is true of all humans is that they spread fast and their cities last.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="tiefling" class="race">
        <img src="images/races/tiefling.png" alt="tiefling">
        <h2>Tiefling</h2>
        <p class="description">Eons ago, some humans made a pact with the Lord of Hell, Asmodeous, and their bloodline became cursed with infernal magic. Though humans in size and lifespan, their appearance includes devilish additions like horns, purple skin and a tail. Many avoid tieflings due to their devilish looks, but their heritage has no effect on their intentions.</p>
