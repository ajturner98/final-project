    <p>There are 13 official classes in fifth edition Dungeons and Dragons â€” 12 of which comes from the Player's Handbook and one from Eberron: Rising from the Last War. Note that this won't help you build your charater (you need the books for that), but it will help you choose what class you want to play! Since Eberron just came out and most people don't have the book yet, this guide will only cover the Player's Handbook classes.</p>

        <h2>Dragonborn</h2>
        <p class="description">Everyone experiences rage, but only a barbarian can use pure anger to enhance their figihing ability. By flying into a potent rage, a barbarian can reduce damage taken, increase their strength and more. This class is a front lines combatant who is really good at taking and dealing tons of damage. One drawback tends to be that they're sometimes limited in useful outside of battle, but they more than make up for it through martial prowess.</p>

As you level up, you can turn into progressively better animals</p>
